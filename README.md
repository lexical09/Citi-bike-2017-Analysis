# Citi-bike-2017-Analysis
Analysis, visulaization and prediction of 2017 Citibike data of 16,364,657 entries with 15 features. 

### Introduction
CitiBike's data sharing information can be found at their [System Data website](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data). They provide information about the data set, such as included variables and their description. The data have been pre-cleaned before uploading, for example by removing trips taken by staff and any trips below 60 seconds in length. This means the data should be ready to use with no need for additional cleaning.

The data are organized in monthly subsets (each in its own '.csv' file) and are available since July 2013, soon after citibike service started, up until September 2018. Using data from one whole year is probably the most appropriate, as there may be yearly patterns. Also, this will provide a good amount of observations, enough for most analysis we may want to do. For this exercise I will thus use all 2017 data, as this is the only full year available so far.

The data are hosted on and can be downloaded from Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).
